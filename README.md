# A theoretical framework for quantum-optical communication - towards CV-QKD

Quantum-optical communication combines quantum aspects of light and communication engineering to bring forth novel approaches to communication.
One of these approaches is quantum-key distribution, enabling practical and secure-key generation.
As a fledgling discipline, quantum-optical communication lacks a unified theoretical framework on which both communication engineers and quantum physicists agree.
Single-mode quantum optics, the standard framework used to describe the quantum properties of light, lacks the notion of a continuous spectrum, essential for communication theory.

The present thesis aims to deliver the missing theoretical framework for quantum-optical communication by reviewing the quantum description of a coherent-state transmission system implementing QKD in three steps:
First, we present and compare QKD protocols and argue why CV-QKD resembles a coherent-state transmission system.
Second, we derive a continuous-mode quantum theory of light rooted in quantum field-theory and apply it to describe the building blocks of a coherent-state transmission system.
Third, we assemble the previously derived building blocks into a coherent-state transmission system and compare them to a software-defined implementation of a coherent-transmission system, emphasizing signal-processing aspects.

Our continuous-mode quantum theory of light is compatible with the few references on continuous-mode quantum optics but is more transparent in the underlying assumptions.
Applied to quantum-optical communication, we motivate a generalized quadrature operator, which accounts for measurements of particular frequency bands.
Furthermore, we show that the electro-optical in-phase and quadrature modulator and balanced detector implement up- and downconversion of classical signal processing.
Applied to CV-QKD, we find a self-contained description that the respective domain experts can agree on, allowing for a future transfer of methods between quantum optics and communication engineering.
