Optical communication enables humanity worldwide to share information in a split second, with companies like Huawei undergoing tremendous efforts to advance the frontiers.
In addition to incremental innovation increasing the performance and decreasing the cost of optical communication technology, we observe intensified activities towards disruptive innovations that challenge our present understanding of communication.
One such branch of activity is quantum optical communication, incorporating quantum aspects of light into classical communication and leading to novel communication technology like \gls{qkd}, which enables practical and secure key generation.
As a still young discipline, which emerged from two highly advanced fields, communication engineering and quantum physics, quantum communication lacks a unified description to which both communication engineers and quantum physicists agree.
The present thesis aims to resolve the seeming discrepancies between communication engineering and quantum physics by reviewing a practical implementation of a quantum communication system implementing a \gls{qkd} protocol.
In the process, we hope to develop a theoretical framework for quantum optical communication, which has applicability beyond \gls{qkd}.
