% HOW DID THE THESIS MAKE A *VALID*, AND *USEFUL*, **CONTRIBUTION TO KNOWLEDGE**?

% answer of your main research question
% **How do we incorporate quantum optics into optical communications?**
% -> We need to employ a continuous-mode formalism and extend the quadrature operator to include a reference frequency and a bandwidth

% summary and reflect (how is it different from the conclusion?)
% conclusion (what have we achieved?)
% primary results:
% - description of a coherent state transmission system used as the communication basis for practical QKD protocols
% - derivation of theoretical framework for quantum optical communication based on coherent states
% secondary results:
% - generalized quadrature operator
% - coherent state transforms for electro-optical components

% limitations (scope)
% - true quantum communication using quantum information sources and non-classical states
% - 

% outlook
% - security proofs with continuous fields (equivalence of tensor product of (single-mode) coherent states with time-continuous coherent state)
% - new protocols inspired from telecommunications (odfm)
% - frequency-entangled states (broadband squeezing)
