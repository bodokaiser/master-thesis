\chapter{Quantum-key distribution}\label{ch:qkd}

Before diving deep into the quantum theory of light, we introduce \gls{qkd} from an abstract communication protocol point of view.

On the one hand, this chapter serves as a high-level introduction to quantum optical communication.
It also provides an overview of the many different layers involved in practical quantum optical communication systems.

This chapter is structured as follows:
First, we motivate the problem of key distribution.
Second, we attempt to classify \gls{qkd} protocols among their common characteristics and propose distinguishing between qubit- or spin-based and boson- or quadrature-based protocols.
Finally, we discuss the classical post-processing procedure required to distill a shared secret key from the quantum transmission data and aspects to consider for information-theoretical security analysis.
