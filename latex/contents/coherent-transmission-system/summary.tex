The real and imaginary part of a complex digital signal $\alpha[n]$ is upsampled, pulse-shaped and converted to anti-aliased analog signals, $x(t)$ and $p(t)$. The analog signals are individually mixed with a phase-shifted \gls{lo} with carrier frequency $\omega_c$ and then added to yield a complex signal $\alpha(t)$.}\label{fig:transmitter_signal_processing}
