\chapter{Coherent state transmission system}

The following chapter describes a coherent state transmission system from a signal-processing point of view, bridging the gap between the quantum theory of optical components and the quantum information theory of the \gls{cvqkd} protocol. In particular, we extend the standard description of a digital transmission system~\cite{Gallager2008,Nossek2015,Oppenheim1989,Proakis2007} to coherent light states following the setup described in Ref.~\cite{Brunner2017}.
