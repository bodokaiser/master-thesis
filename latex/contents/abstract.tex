\section*{Abstract}

Quantum-optical communication combines quantum aspects of light and communication engineering to bring forth novel approaches to communication.
One of these approaches is quantum-key distribution, enabling practical and secure-key generation.
As a fledgling discipline, quantum-optical communication lacks a unified theoretical framework to which both communication engineers and quantum physicists agree.
Single-mode quantum optics, the standard framework used to describe the quantum properties of light, lacks the notion of a continuous spectrum essential for communication theory.

The present thesis aims to deliver the missing theoretical framework for quantum-optical communication by reviewing the quantum description of a coherent-state transmission system implementing \gls{qkd} in three steps:
First, we present and compare \gls{qkd} protocols and argue why \gls{cvqkd} resembles a coherent-state transmission system.
Second, we derive a continuous-mode quantum theory of light rooted in quantum field-theory and apply it to describe the building blocks of a coherent-state transmission system.
Third, we assemble the previously derived building blocks to a coherent-state transmission system and compare it to a software-defined implementation of a coherent-transmission system with emphasizes on the signal processing aspects.

Our continuous-mode quantum theory of light is compatible with few references on continuous-mode quantum optics but is more transparent in the underlying assumptions.
Applied to quantum-optical communication, we motivated a generalized quadrature operator, which accounts for measurements of particular frequency bands.
Furthermore, we showed that the electro-optical \gls{iq} modulator and balanced detector implement up- and downconversion of classical signal processing.

Applied to \gls{cvqkd}, we found a self-contained description that the respective domain experts can agree on, allowing for a future transfer of methods between quantum optics and telecommunication, single-mode quantum optics, the standard framework used to describe the quantum properties of light, lacks the notion of a continuous spectrum essential for communication theory.
