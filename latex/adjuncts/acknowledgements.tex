\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I want to thank Monika for making the present thesis possible and supporting me selflessly on my journey over the last few years.

I want to thank Hans for welcoming me to the group and looking out for me. Hans introduced me to CV-QKD and provided me with a kickstart in signal processing. Hans is gifted with a deep intuition asking the right questions and confronting my physics-me with the harsh non-idealities of the real world.

I want to thank Fred for the many fun moments and waves of laughter we had together. Fred was always open to my stupid ideas and patiently pointing out my logical fallacies. Fred was my go-to contact for questions related to quantum information theory, in particular, quantum-key distribution.

I want to thank Momtchil for being always available 24/7 and looking out for me concerning administrative issues.
The thesis strongly benefited from Momtchil's deep theoretical understanding of quantum optics, mechanics, and mathematical physics.

I want to thank Stefano for his humor and rich life experiences wrapped in many funny anecdotes. My understanding of the electro-optical components and macroscopic electrodynamics is mainly due to him.

Lastly, I want to thank my family and friends for supporting me through challenging times, questioning my assumptions, inspiring me, caring about my feelings and emotions.
In particular, I want to thank Julia for truly wanting the best for me and having me build trust in my feelings and intuition.
