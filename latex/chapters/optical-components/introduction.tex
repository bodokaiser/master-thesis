\textit{The following chapter presents an in-depth discussion of the classical and quantum characteristics of important optical components. In particular, we need to describe optical couplers, modulators and detectors in using a continuous-mode time-dependent quantum theory.}
% Use semiclassical laser theory as described in Wolf & Mandel. p. 929 to derive an expression for the classical current.
% Use the classical current to give coherent state.
