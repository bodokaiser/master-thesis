We know two approaches to quantum optics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Axiomatic Fock space
    \item Canonical quantization of relativistic field theory
\end{enumerate}
The first approach is mathematical concise, while the second approach allows usage of many physic utilities.

We want to combine both approaches:
Using the physical insights and tools from quantum field theory to describe the operators and the symmetric Fock space state to construct the quantum states.
