\section{Quantum science and technology}

We are in the acceleration stage of a second quantum revolution.
While the first quantum revolution unveiled us the - often counterintuitive - rules of quantum mechanics, the second quantum revolution breaches a new level of understanding and control of applied quantum systems.
Notable results of the last century include, for instance, the widespread adaption of the laser, the transistor, and nuclear-magnetic-resonance tomography.
Recently, the second quantum revolution gained further momentum by attracting widespread public and political interest.
Quantum technologies are seen as critical technologies for the upcoming decades, and public institutions fear losing the technological race.

\subsection{Quantum communication}

% TODO: why QKD? (most mature of all "new" quantum technologies)

% actually quantum communication -> quantum key-distribution
% most mature quantum technology
% commercial adaption (name some examples, QKD networks)
