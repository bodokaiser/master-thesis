	\caption{Tensor-product coherent state transmission system: A transmitter encodes a sequence of complex symbols $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$ onto a tensor product of coherent states $\ket{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n}$. The quantum channel maps the coherent state $\ket{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n}$ to a coherent state $\ket{\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n}$ from which the receiver decodes the complex symbols $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n$. Each symbol pair is completely independent and a received symbol $\beta_k$ is a random variable following a complex normal distribution with mean $\alpha_k$ and variance $\sigma^2$ where the variance is equal to the quantum shot noise.}

	\caption{Time-continuous coherent state transmission system: A transmitter encodes a sequence of complex symbols $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$ onto a time-continuous coherent state $\ket{\alpha(t)}$. The quantum channel maps the coherent state $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ to a coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$ from which the receiver decodes the complex symbols $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n$. In general, each symbol pair depends on the other symbols and a received symbol $\beta_k$ is a random variable following a complex normal distribution with mean $f(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ and variance $\sigma$.}

Additional motivation:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First complete description of a practical \gls{cvqkd} implementation incorporating the different viewpoints of the involved disciplines, e.g., quantum optics, communication engineering, and quantum information theory.
	\item Intellectual challenge of applying the reductionistic quantum optics framework to a practical system involving imperfections.
