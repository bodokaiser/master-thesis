\section{Problem statement}

Shortcomings of the state of the art:
 Most \gls{qkd} literature is extremely specific to the authors background, e.g., quantum optics, communication engineering, quantum information theory, while neglecting the view points of other fields.
However, one needs to the integrate all the view points and agree on a common language to get the whole picture.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first complete description of a \gls{cvqkd} implementation incorporating a time-dependent continuous-mode description of quantum states.

On an intellectual level, the complete description of a \gls{cvqkd} device heavily challenges us our understanding of physics.
In particular, we found that there are many implicit assumptions made to carry classical results over to a quantum model.
