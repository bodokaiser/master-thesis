\section{Problem statement and motivation}

% signal-processing uses continuous frequency spectras while quantum optics uses single frequency modes
% no complete fully-connected description of a practical QKD device reported so far
% intersections of different disciplines: signal-processing, quantum optics, quantum information theory, quantum field theory
