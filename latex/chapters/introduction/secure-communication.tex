\section{Secure communication}

% \section{Quantum communication}
% actually quantum communication -> quantum key-distribution
% most mature quantum technology
% commercial adaption (name some examples, QKD networks)

% eternal secure communication
% symmetric ciphers
% asymmetric ciphers for key-exchange
% problems with asymmetric ciphers
% quantum key-distribution as mechanism for secure key exchange

% very basic idea
% assumptions
% protocol (Alice sends state, Bob measures)
% dv most simple, developed in academia, difficult for practical use because of ....
% cv developed in industry because of benefits ...
