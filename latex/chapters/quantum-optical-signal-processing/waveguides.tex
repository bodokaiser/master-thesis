\section{Waveguides}

So far, we discussed the free-field in which the states disperse quickly as seen in the first chapter.
Therefore, most optical communication is conducted using waveguide.

We can amend the developed formalism by replacing the linear dispersion relation of the Maxwell field by a dispersion relation matching the waveguides transmission properties.

\subsection{Fiber}

Optical fibers are dielectric cylindrical waveguides.

\subsection{Loss}

Loss needs to be modeled by the exchange with an environment
