	\caption{Block diagram of the \gls{iq}-demodulator: The sinusoidal local oscillator is divided into two branches. The upper branch is mixed with the real passband signal $\Re\{\alpha(t)e^{-i\omega_ct}\}$, anti-aliased by a \gls{lp} filter to give the baseband signal $p(t)$. The lower branch is phase-shifted by $\pi/2$, nixed with the real passband signal $\Re\{\alpha(t)e^{-i\omega_ct}\}$, anti-aliased by a \gls{lp} filter to give the baseband signal $x(t)$.}\label{fig:demodulator}

The coupler outputs are monitored by the photodiodes PD1 and PD2 in balanced photodetection configuration. The balanced photocurrent is amplified by an \gls{tia}.}
