The transmitter encodes the symbols $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$ onto a coherent state $\ket{\alpha(t)}$. The channel maps from $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ to a coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$. The receiver decodes a symbol sequence $\beta_1\dots,\beta_n$ from $\ket{\beta(t)}$.}\label{fig:transmission_system}

Let $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\in\mathbb{C}$ and $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n\in\mathbb{C}$ be two sequences of complex numbers, called the symbols, then a coherent state transmission system encodes the symbols $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$ onto a coherent state $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ in a transmitter and sends it over a quantum channel, which maps $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ to a coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$ at a receiver, which decodes the symbols $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n$ from the coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$, see \Cref{fig:transmission_system}.
