\section{Overview}

Let $\alpha[n],\beta[n]$ be two complex sequences, referred to as symbols.
A coherent state transmission system comprises a transmitter, a quantum channel, and a receiver, see \Cref{fig:transmission_system}.

	\caption{Coherent state transmission system comprising a transmitter, a quantum channel, and a receiver. The transmitter encodes the symbol $\alpha[n]$ onto a coherent state $\ket{\alpha(t)}$. The channel maps from $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ to a coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$. The receiver decodes a symbol sequence $\beta[n]$ from $\ket{\beta(t)}$.}\label{fig:transmission_system}

The transmitter encodes the symbols $\alpha[n]$ onto a coherent state $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ and passes it to the quantum channel.
The quantum channel maps $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ to a coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$ at a receiver, which decodes the symbols $\beta[n]$ from the coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$.
