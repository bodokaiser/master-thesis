\section{Overview}

Let $M\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ denote an index set, $\left\{\alpha_n\right\}_{n\in M}$ as well as $\left\{\beta_n\right\}_{n\in M}$ two complex sequences, referred to as symbols.
A coherent state transmission system comprises a transmitter, a quantum channel, and a receiver, see \Cref{fig:transmission_system}.

The transmitter encodes the symbols $\left\{\alpha_n\right\}_{n\in M}$ onto a coherent state $\ket{\alpha(t)}$. The channel maps from $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ to a coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$. The receiver decodes a symbol sequence $\left\{\beta_n\right\}_{n\in M}$ from $\ket{\beta(t)}$.}\label{fig:transmission_system}

The transmitter encodes the symbols $\left\{\alpha_n\right\}_{n\in M}$ onto a coherent state $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ and passes it to the quantum channel.
The quantum channel maps $\ket{\alpha(t)}$ to a coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$ at a receiver, which decodes the symbols $\left\{\beta_n\right\}_{n\in M}$ from the coherent state $\ket{\beta(t)}$.
