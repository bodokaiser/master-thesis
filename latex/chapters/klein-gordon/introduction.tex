The Klein-Gordon field is the most basic relativistic field theory describing scalar field excitations.
Although neither fermions nor photons are exactly scalar fields, their components do satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation.
In the following chapter, we give a thorough discussion of the Klein-Gordon field, and in particular, its quantum states.
Later, we will transfer the results obtained for the Klein-Gordon field to the Maxwell field.

The chapter is structured as follows.
In the first section, we discuss the Klein-Gordon field in the framework of relativistic field theory.
In the second section, we perform the canonical quantization of the Klein-Gordon field.
In the third and last section, we discuss quantum states of the Klein-Gordon field, particularly the number and coherent state.
