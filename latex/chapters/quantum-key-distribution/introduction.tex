The present chapter identifies common characteristics of \gls{qkd} protocols and attempts to formalize the notion of a \gls{qkd} protocol.
We test the proposed formula with qubit-based \gls{qkd} protocols like BB84 and the six-state protocol as well as Gaussian \gls{cvqkd} protocols.
The chapter ends with a summary and literature review regarding practical \gls{qkd} protocols' post-processing and security analysis.
