\Cref{fig:qkd_protocol} illustrates our proposed notion of a \gls{qkd} protocol, with the feature being a logical quantum system from which the random bits are encoded and decoded.
The logical quantum system is a subspace of the physical quantum system.
The physical quantum system depends strongly on the physical implementation and quantum encoding.

	\caption{An abstract \gls{qkd} protocol comprises a binary encoder, a logical quantum system, a binary decoder, and some post-processing. The binary encoder maps bits onto a quantum state of the logical quantum system. The binary decoder extracts the bits from the logical quantum system. The logical quantum system is a subspace of a larger physical quantum system. The state encoder and decoder map between the logical and physical quantum states.}\label{fig:qkd_protocol}

The distinction between logical and quantum systems is vital to separate the implementation and security concerns.
Many security proofs show equivalence between the physical implementation and the logical system to use an established security proof.
One should keep in mind that such a separation implicitly assumes no loopholes from the particular implementation.
