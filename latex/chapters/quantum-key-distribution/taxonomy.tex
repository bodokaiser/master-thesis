\section{Taxonomy of protocols}

\Cref{fig:qkd_classification} illustrates common features among the \gls{qkd} protocols.
For an overview of \gls{qkd} protocols, see Ref.~\cite{Duvsek2006}.

Every \gls{qkd} system requires a detector, e.g., a coherent detector or a single-photon (click) detector.
The detection does not necessarily imply the dimension of the logical state space.
For instance, BB84 having a two-dimensional logical state space has been implemented with coherent detection~\cite{Qi2021} having a countable detection space.
It remains to discuss where to place differential-phase-shift \gls{dps} \gls{qkd} into the proposed categories.
Concerning measurement basis selection, Bob can either actively choose a random measurement basis for every transmission or passively measure all (orthogonal) bases for measurement basis selection.
We will cover both active and passive measurement basis selection in the discussion of the polarization-encoding BB84 protocol.
Finally, the \gls{qkd} schema determines if either Alice prepares a state and sends it to Bob for measurement (prepare-and-measure) or if Alice and Bob share an entangled state (entanglement-based).
Most practical \gls{qkd} implementations use prepare-and-measure.
On a theoretical level, both schemas are equivalent, and security proofs are often more convenient in an entanglement-based setting.
