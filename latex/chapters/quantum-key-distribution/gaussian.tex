\section{Gaussian-based protocols}

In \gls{cvqkd}, the receiver performs a continuous-value measurement, i.e., the set of possible outcomes is uncountable.
In comparison to \gls{dvqkd}, \gls{cvqkd} generates random bits faster but with higher error.
Grosshans initially proposed \gls{cvqkd} in 2002 as an alternative to DV-QKD~\cite{Grosshans2002}.
Today, CV-QKD has grown into solid competition with DV-QKD~\cite{Diamanti2016}.
One significant advantage of CV-QKD over DV-QKD is that the CV-QKD receiver uses standard telecommunication components allowing for cheap high-performance integration.
