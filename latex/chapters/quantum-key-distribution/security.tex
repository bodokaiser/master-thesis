\section{Security analysis}

For completeness, we provide a short literature review regarding \gls{qkd} security proofs, but a detailed security proof is not the subject matter of the present thesis.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item main idea how a security proof works?
	\item individual, collective and coherent attacks
	\item reduction of coherent to collective attacks~\cite{Renner2009}
	\item outline idea of a security proof
	\item $\varepsilon$-security
\end{enumerate}

Ref.~\cite{Lo2014} and Ref.~\cite{Laudenbach2018} provides an introduction to practical \gls{qkd} security including implementation vectors.
A more theoretical but still practical security analysis for \gls{qkd} is found in Ref.~\cite{Scarani2009}.
For a security analysis particular to \gls{cvqkd}, see Ref.~\cite{Diamanti2015}.

For a in-depth security analysis of the post-processing, see Ref.~\cite{Fung2010}.
For a proof of privacy amplification in the \gls{qkd} context, see Ref.~\cite{Renner2005}
