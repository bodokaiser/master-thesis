# Introduction to the introduction 

### Subject areas

* Communication engineering (classical optical communication)
* Quantum optics (quantum mechanics)

### Thesis' aim

Develop a theoretical framework for quantum optical communication (towards practical QKD)

### Primary research question

* How to incorporate quantum aspects into classical optical communication?

### Objectives

* Common language which both communication engineers and quantum physisits can agree on.
* Justified steps, transparent assumptions -> often sources for confusion

# Details

## Context

### Quantum optics

* Single-mode, light as quantum harmonic oscillator

### Communication engineering

* Bandwidth(-limitation)
* Passband, baseband signal

### Quantum communication

* QKD
* Quantum information?

## Concepts and variables

* Quantum field theory
* Time-continuous signals
* Frequency and time domain (Fourier uncertainty)
* Bandwidth
* Single-mode quantum optics (harmonic oscillator)
* Interactions (interaction picture/Hamiltonian)
* Quantum state (coherent, number)
* Quadratures, amplitude/phase

## Secondary research questions

* What is the proper generalization of single-mode quantum-optics to a mode continuum? What is the scope thereof?
* How to code classical information onto coherent states?
* How to measure specific signal bands?
* How does a theoretical framework help to understand and develop QKD protocols (coherent state transmission system)

## Literature

Single- and multi-mode quantum optics:
* Gerry & Knight
* Fox

Continuos-mode quantum optics:
* Loudon
* Barnett

Quantum optics (photodetection, etc.):
* Shapiro
* Vogel
* Mandel & Wolf

Optical communication:
* Kikuchi

Quantum field theory:
* Itzykson
* Peskin & Schroeder
* Greiner
* Stone?
* ...

Shortcomings of the current literature:
* Single-mode quantum optics lack notion of frequency spectrum.
* Continuous-mode quantum optics unclear/unjustified
* Advanced literature very problem specific
* Quantum field theory applied to different problems (scattering amplitudes)

## Scope

* Preliminaries (what should the reader know)?
* No experiment (mainly theoretical arguments)
* No mathematical thesis

## Outline why the research is important and the contribution that it makes
 
* The theory presented in the thesis allows the transfer of methods from (optical) communication to quantum optics.
* The thesis provides a deep understanding into a complete quantum description of light towards communication.

## State the hypotheses

Quantum field theory provides the most complete description of electromagnetism as we know including elements required for signal-processing (momentum/frequency distribution/spectrum).
However, quantum field theory is formulated with application to particle physics in mind (scattering amplitudes, ...) and not quantum optics where the quantum state and unitary operators acting upon are important.

If we can "develope" quantum field theory towards a quantum optical description, we find the missing elements for communication, and because we know that quantum field theory is experimentally found, we have some confidence in these results.
